## Common

If authentication is required, retrieve the session information using `getSessionOrReject` in `src/app/_actions/auth.ts`. Make sure to do this if server components and server actions require authentication.

## Pages

directory: `src/app/(private)`, `src/app/(public)`

If a page requires authentication, create it in `(private)` directory, otherwise create it in `(public)` directory.

## Server Actions

directory: `src/app/_actions`

rules:
  - Use the `Result` type for return values, and if there is a result, store it in data.
    - the `Result` type is src/app/\_actions/types.ts
  - Always enforce authentication.
