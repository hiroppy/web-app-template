globs: src/app/**/*.tsx, src/app/_hooks/*.tsx?

## Components

- Components should be defined using the `function` keyword, not arrow functions.
- Define a type for the component's props.
- Use `PropsWithChildren` if the component has children.
- File names should follow UpperCamelCase naming convention.
- To access session information, use `_clients/nextAuth`.
- Use `Tailwind CSS` for styling, and `clsx` for combining classes.
- For shared components, place them in `src/app/_components`. Components that are likely to be used only on a specific page should be placed in the `_components` directory within that page. If the directory does not exist, create it.

## Hooks

- Hooks should be defined using the `function` keyword, not arrow functions.
- Hooks should be created in the `src/app/_hooks` directory.
- The file name and function name should match, and the function name should start with the prefix use.
- Avoid default exports; instead, use named exports.
- Use useMemo or useCallback to memoize variables and functions when necessary.
- Return values should be in an object format with `<const>` for better type inference.
